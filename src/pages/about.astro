<p>My name is Bryan Robinson. I'm a designer, developer and teacher based in Michigan. I've been passionate about HTML, CSS and JS for my entire career, and I want to teach you to be just as passionate about it, as well.</p>

<p>I've spoken nationally about modern CSS. I write regularly about CSS on my own blog, and I recently had the opportunity to write about it for CSS Tricks (still very proud of this). I've mentored designers to be developers and developers to be designers.</p>
